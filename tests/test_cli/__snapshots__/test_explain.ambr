  WPS123 â€” Forbid unused variables with multiple underscores.
  
  Reasoning:
      We only use ``_`` as a special definition for an unused variable.
      Other variables are hard to read. It is unclear why would one use it.
  
  Solution:
      Rename unused variables to ``_``
      or give it some more context with an explicit name: ``_context``.
  
  Example::
  
      # Correct:
      some_element, _next_element, _ = some_tuple()
      some_element, _, _ = some_tuple()
      some_element, _ = some_tuple()
  
      # Wrong:
      some_element, _, __  = some_tuple()
  
  .. versionadded:: 0.12.0
